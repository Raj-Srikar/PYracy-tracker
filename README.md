Text_Insert program will insert the code onto a single frame of the movie.

Detect_Text program will go to the particular frame of the movie, where the code has been inserted and will crop the part of the frame, where the code is present and saves the cropped portion of the frame as JPG file. This file is then enlarged for the better detection of the code. The detected code will be printed in the output screen.

Thanks
